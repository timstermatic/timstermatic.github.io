Today I received my MongoDB for Developers certificate. Here it is in most of its glory:

I'd recommend anyone interested in learning about MongoDB to give it a go. The course is 6 weeks long and you also get to learn a bit of Python along the journey. As it's offered by 10gen, the company who develop MongoDB, it's probably the best source of learning on the subject.

There are a few courses specialised by language which you can find on their [list of mongodb courses](https://education.10gen.com/courses/).

I'm now on my first week of MongoDB for Node.js developers, and I hear there may be a C# one in the pipeline.
